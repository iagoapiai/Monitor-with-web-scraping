# Monitor-with-web-scraping
The Python script performs web scraping on the company's website, accessing each client individually to check if the asset is online. If the parameter changes from offline to online or vice versa, it records the change in a .csv file, which essentially serves as an improvised database, and notifies the parameter change through a message on Discord.
